# Deprecated Workloads

## Street (FSNS)

Recurrent neural network for classifying French Street signs. This model required a lot
of modification to get working in Tensorflow 1.12, and the initial data from snooping did
not look very good (i.e. wrong). Thus, this workload is classified as deprecated.
